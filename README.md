# Big-Data-Foundation
Big Data Guide Hey everyone this is a repository where I discus Big Data technologies. It originally a rose out of my notes that I took while learning about various things. For the most part I will be focusing on Open Source Technologies and Big Data Systems design although I will briefly describe some other things. If you see anything incorrect or anything that should be added feel free to fork and make a pull request.  Disclaimer  This is an informal repository created in my free time. Although I try to as accurate as possible I'm not perfect. As such it is highly reccomended that you check official documentation before attempting anything. Neither myself nor any contributors can be held responsible for incorrect or wrong information.
